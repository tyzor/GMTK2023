Theme: Role Reversal

Idea: You are the AI/Designer and have to keep the hero entertained/motivated, you will draft dungeon pieces to place down
as the hero progresses through the game.

Hero will have attributes:
    - health - if the hero dies the game is over (lose)
    - boredom - if the hero reaches max boredom they leave the dungeon (lose)
        - increases as the hero stays at max health or does not find loot
    - xp - increases every time a monster is defeated?
        - 100 xp = new level and hero gains stats (just hp for now)


    - other traits? 
        - greedy -> hero will always go for loot 
        - heroic -> hero will seek out every monster on the level
        - speedrunner -> hero will find the fastest path to the exit


Dungeon tiles should be premade pieces that have an entrance and exit
